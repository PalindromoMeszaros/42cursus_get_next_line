### Challenge
**Subject** *We must create a function that returns a line reas from a file descriptor followed by a newline*
  
- If we call again the function , it should return the next line of the file descriptor -the project is oriented towards learning the concept of static variables-

As bonuses it should be able to:  
  
* Being able to read from and alternate between multiple file descriptors
* Use a single static variable
  
Standard library functions can't be used. We are able to use any function made by ourselves and included in ft_libft. We can use the functions `read`, `malloc` & `free`
The function must conform to 42's norm.
